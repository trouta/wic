		<h1>NEWS</h1>
		<h2>First Meeting of the Semester!</h2>
		<p>Join us for our first meeting of the semester in a <a target="_blank" href="https://gvsu-edu.zoom.us/j/92281957845?pwd=cjR5OWhKNlM5SzRJczhiQk1vQStMdz09">Zoom Call</a>! We'll be going over introductions and playing some Jackbox games. We are looking forward to seeing old and new members alike! Please contact us if you have any questions or have any issue connecting with us.</p>

		<h2>WIC Meetings This Fall</h2>
		<p>As of right now, WIC is planning on hosting meetings through Zoom for the fall semester. That said, the executive board is planning on providing opportunities to meet in person if members are interested. More details regarding the semester's schedule will be updated when available.</p>

		<h2>PCEC Videos</h2>
		<p>We have been asked to continue to help PCEC gain viewership and a larger following with videos about computing! These videos would discuss topics such as what you can do with a particular degree, explaining a concept in your field (something fun or interesting to you), why you chose your field of study, and/or describing/demonstrating an activity that kids could do at home. If you already have video content created for any classes you have taken that you would like to share, those would be great too! If enough videos are generated, they plan to create a playlist and publish a news story about it. Let's encourage more students to join us in the computing field at GV! The current plan is for videos to be shared on YouTube/Instagram starting around mid-July (around one a week). If you would like to contribute any short videos (around 5 minutes or less) to PCEC's social media, please share them on <a href="https://forms.gle/5b72T54kBLjaW5eUA" target="_blank">this google form</a>!</p>

		<h2>Career Panel</h2>
		<p>In light of recent events and in the interests of safety, the WIC executive board is currently planning for a virtual career panel this fall in lieu of our normal event. We're planning to invite employers to speak on behalf of their respective companies, participate in a Q&A, and allow students the opportunity to engage with representatives. In the past, we've offered resume feedback from representatives, but we aren't sure just yet whether or not this will be possible for the virtual event as we are currently planning on using Zoom. More information will be posted as it becomes available. If you are an employer and you would like to participate in this event, please contact us by <a href="mailto:wic@mail.gvsu.edu">our email</a>.</p>

		<h2>WIC Merchandise</h2>
		<p>Due to the pandemic, WIC had a budget surplus for the year. We decided to invest this money in buying WIC merch that will be free to students. Merch comes in several varieties (buttons and stickers) and features this year's t-shirt design. One pin also features last year's design, both of which were created by former WIC President Kasey Stowell. Merch will be available for pickup in person during the school year, and we are able to mail merch to those who won't be returning to Allendale in the fall. If you would like us to mail you some WIC merch, please <a href="https://forms.gle/x7sroorxj4PetrHp7" target="_blank">fill out this form</a> to submit your preferences and address. Otherwise if you'll be returning in the fall, we plan to stock some merch in the CIS office so make sure to drop by and grab some!</p>

		<h2>End of Year Feedback</h2>
		<p>We're gathering feedback on this year's activities and engagement, and your opinion is very valuable to us. This feedback will help shape next year's schedule, activities, and goals. Please <a href="https://forms.gle/JDys2yDGJ8iGVs3W7" target="_blank">take the survey</a> to help us make informed decisions for the future of WIC.</p>

		<h2>WIC 2019-2020 T-Shirt</h2>
		<p>Our yearly t-shirt is up for sale! This is WIC's primary fundraising opportunity. A small profit from each shirt goes towards next year's activities. Consider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/women-in-computing-2019-2020-shirt/">purchasing a shirt</a> to support WIC. This year's design was created by WIC alumna Kasey Stowell.</p>
